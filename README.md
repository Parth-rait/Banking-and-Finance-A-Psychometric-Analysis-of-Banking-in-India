India’s banking system, though lauded for its democratic aims (e.g. bank nationalization for mass
outreach), often operates more like a trickle-down system than a truly inclusive one. Rather than
immediately empowering the poorest, credit and services tend to concentrate among established
institutions and wealthier clients, with benefits “trickling down” only slowly (if at all) to weaker
sectionsiimidr.ac.inccsenet.org. This has significant consequences: as Deputy Governor Chakrabarty
observes, “economic growth in India has not been inclusive; unemployment and poverty remain
high and a vast majority of the population remains excluded from health and education facilities”
iimidr.ac.in. In practical terms, only about one-third of Indians even have a formal bank
accountiimidr.ac.in, and many of those accounts lie dormant, unused for monthsiimidr.ac.in.
Likewise, rural and low-income households continue to depend heavily on informal lenders:
NABARD data suggest only ~8% of rural households access formal creditpmfias.com, leaving vast
segments effectively “unbanked” or under-banked.
These patterns raise urgent research questions about structural biases in India’s banking: Why does
the system favor certain actors and channels? Are cooperative and NABARD-supported institutions
truly more inclusive than large public or private banks? Does the prevailing “banking-as-
democracy” model inadvertently reinforce existing power divides instead of flattening them?
Moreover, at the user level, how do attitudes and literacy shape choices between safe financial
products (like mutual funds) versus speculative ones (like betting and gaming apps)? Why, for
example, might risk-prone individuals flock to gambling platforms while shunning mutual funds?
We also ask whether innovative mechanisms (such as designated Education Funds, Health Funds,
or Agricultural Demand Funds) could be designed to channel that speculative energy into socially
productive outcomes.
This study takes a multidimensional approach. First, we compare institutional reach and control:
how do public/private banks versus regional rural banks (RRBs) and cooperatives differ in access,
lending, and priorities? Second, we analyze consumer behavior: how do financial literacy, trust, and
risk attitudes influence investment choices? Third, we develop a conceptual framework
contrasting trickle-down banking with a power-divided (participatory) model, and we explore how
risk-allocation theory can inform the design of new funding vehicles. Geographically, Maharashtra
serves as our primary case (with its large rural economy and extensive cooperative network), while
Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh serve as secondary comparators(mostly as a comparative study);
Delhi (my home place) provides an urban benchmark.
The contributions of this work include:
• Empirical analysis of inclusion gaps: We synthesize national and state data (e.g. RBI/
NABARD reports) showing that fewer than half of Indians use formal banking services
activelyiimidr.ac.ineacpm.gov.in. We identify how much credit flows through cooperatives
vs. commercial banksnabard.orgnabard.org, and highlight state-level disparities (for
Maharashtra, Karnataka, MP vs. Delhi).
• Institutional insights: By reviewing cooperative banks, NABARD, and RRB mandates, we
show that cooperatives often get targeted refinances (e.g. ~73% of short-term agrarian
refinancenabard.org) and local outreach, whereas large banks capture bulk loans (e.g. in
Karnataka 90% of advances are through commercial banksnabard.org). This reveals a
misalignment: policies may intend cooperative inclusion, but real credit still flows via big
banks.

• Consumer behavior linkages: We connect findings on financial literacy and risk
preferences to actual choices. For instance, studies find that higher literacy correlates with
mutual fund investmentris.org.in, while low literacy and impulsive biases drive gambling-
and game-app spendingeconomictimes.indiatimes.commdpi.com. We use recent data (e.g.
the 2025 Economic Times report of ₹30,000 cr in gaming/astrology app revenue vs. only
~5 crore SIP investorseconomictimes.indiatimes.com) to illustrate this “risk on recklessness”
trend.
• New frameworks: We propose reframing the problem as a power-allocation issue. By
contrasting a top-down, trickle-down model with a decentralized “banking democracy”
model, we clarify why simply opening accounts is not enough — governance,
accountability, and trust matter. We also outline how “risk allocation theory” suggests
channeling risk-seeking behaviors into regulated funds (e.g. Education, Health, Agriculture
Bonds) that finance social goods, turning gambling impulses into structured investments.
By anchoring these analyses in current data and scholarship, our aim is to lay a comprehensive
foundation: one that guides the later empirical chapters and addresses readers’ doubts about
institutional roles, regional variation, and the human factors in finance.
